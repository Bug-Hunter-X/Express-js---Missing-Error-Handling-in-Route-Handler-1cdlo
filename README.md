# Express.js - Missing Error Handling in Route Handler

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: inadequate error handling in route handlers.  The `bug.js` file shows a route that lacks proper checks for database errors and the absence of requested resources. This can lead to unexpected behavior and unhelpful error messages for clients.

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version, including comprehensive error handling and informative responses to clients.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install necessary packages (you'll need to have a database setup).
3. Start the server using `node bug.js`.
4. Observe the lack of clear error responses when requesting non-existent users or encountering database issues.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 for `bugSolution.js` to see the improvement in error handling.
